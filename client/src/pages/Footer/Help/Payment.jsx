      <h3>What steps does AuctionX take to prevent card fraud?</h3>
      <p>
        AuctionX realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and
        resolution capability. We and our online payments partners monitor
        transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag potentially
        fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of
        fraud categorically, the transaction is kept on hold, and the customer
        is requested to provide identity documents. The ID documents help us
        ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine cardholder. We
        apologize for any inconvenience caused and request customers to bear
        with us in the interest of ensuring a safe and secure environment for
        online transactions.
